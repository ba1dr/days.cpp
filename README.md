# days.cpp - Reminder for important dates

## Intro

This program was my proud in former days.

I was growing up as a programmer while creating it. At first 3 releases it was written with Turbo Pascal, being completely rewritten each time with new approach. Versions 4 and 5 were created with C++ - with functions and then object-oriented.

I am storing it here as some kind of portfolio but also to keep it in my memory :) .


## Description

This is the MS-DOS program intended to run and display a colorful notification about some ongoing holidays/birthdays/any dates.

The dates are stored in the file 'days.txd' and can be processed with some kind of interpreted language.

The description (on Russian, in CP866 encoding - I am sorry) is provided in the text file 'days.doc'.

Whole project is stored in MSDOS cyrillic encoding CP866 including some comments inside.

Versions 4 and 5 are stored in subfolder 'old'.

Compiled version is available in the file 'days_compiled.zip' .
